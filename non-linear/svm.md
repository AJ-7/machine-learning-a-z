# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Allows to classify data that is linearly separable
- If it isn't linearly separable, you can use the kernel trick to make it work
  - Linear kernel
  - Polynomial kernel
  - Radial kernel
- Compared to neueal networks, they have two main advantages
  1. Higher speed &
  2. Better performance with a limited number of samples

It's goal is to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margins from both classes. In other words: the hyperplane whose distance to the nearest element of each class is the largest
