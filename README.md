Two main classes of ML algorithms

Comparison  | Parametric | Nonparametric
----------  | ----------- | ---------------
Benefits    | easier to understand | 
            | easier to interpret results | 
            | faster to learn from data |
            | can work with less training data | 
            | can work well even if the fit to the data isn't perfect | 
            | 
Limitations | | 

Another way to group ML algorithms is **by the way they learn**

- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Semi-Supervised
